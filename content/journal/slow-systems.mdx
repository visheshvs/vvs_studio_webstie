excerpt: "Building things that resist the pressure to be fast, viral, or algorithmic."

Everything wants to be fast now. Fast loading. Fast growth. Fast feedback loops. Fast, frictionless, instant.

But some things benefit from slowness. From friction. From the time it takes to get from one place to another.

This is an experiment in slow systems.

## Intentional Friction

No infinite scroll here. Pagination forces a pause, a decision. Do you want to see more? Then choose to.

No comments. No likes. No real-time metrics feeding back into what gets made. Just things, existing.

No algorithm deciding what you see. Just chronology. Time as the organizing principle.

## Why Slow?

Because attention is the main ingredient in everything worth making, and attention requires time.

Because the good stuff emerges from sustained engagement, not hot takes.

Because I want to build something that could last—not in the "preserve it in amber" sense, but in the "remains useful and true" sense.

## Against Virality

Viral growth is antithetical to the kind of thing I'm trying to build here.

Viral means:
- Optimizing for shareability
- Smoothing away friction
- Designing for first impressions
- Measuring success in reach

What I'm after:
- Depth over breadth
- Returning visitors over new traffic  
- Meaning over metrics
- Mattering to someone over mattering to everyone

So this is slow. Deliberately. Structurally.

If it ever feels fast, something's wrong.
