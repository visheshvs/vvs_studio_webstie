The best ideas never start in the center of the page.

They start in margins. In the white space between the "real" work. In the doodles and asides and half-thoughts that accumulate while you're supposedly doing something else.

I've been keeping what I call "margin notebooks" for years now. Cheap, unimportant-feeling books where nothing matters. Where a bad idea costs nothing and a good idea doesn't demand immediate action.

## Permission Structures

That's what margins are, really. **Permission structures.**

Permission to:
- Be incomplete
- Be wrong
- Be boring
- Be weird
- Start over

The center of the page demands too much. It's where finished things live. But margins? Margins are generous.

Not the comments section. Not the drafts folder. Something else. Something that feels unimportant enough to be free.

Maybe this is it. Maybe that's what a journal can be. Digital margin space.

Let's find out.
