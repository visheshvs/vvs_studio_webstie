excerpt: "Observations on texture, paper stock, and the physicality of making things."

Spent the morning sorting through paper samples. There's something meditative about it—feeling the weight, seeing how light moves across different surfaces.

Digital work often feels weightless. Infinite undos. Frictionless changes. But that friction, that resistance of material—that's where interesting things happen.

## On Weight

60lb versus 80lb versus 110lb cover stock. Each one suggests a different kind of object. A different relationship with the reader.

Heavier doesn't always mean better. Sometimes you want something ephemeral. A thing that feels like it might blow away.

## Texture Memory

Your hands remember things your brain forgets. The tooth of cold-press watercolor paper. The smooth slip of coated stock. The soft resistance of good cotton bond.

These memories inform everything else—even the digital work. Even this.
