Every project starts somewhere. This is where this one begins—not with fanfare, but with intention.

There's something about the blank page that feels both terrifying and liberating. No history, no expectations—just the weight of possibility.

I've been thinking about spaces lately. Physical spaces, digital spaces, the spaces between thoughts. How they shape what happens within them. How a well-worn desk encourages different work than a pristine one.

This studio—both the physical room I'm sitting in and this digital one you're exploring—is an attempt to create that kind of intentional space. Not a gallery. Not a feed. Just a place where things can exist and breathe.

## What This Is

A place for:
- Process over polish
- Fragments over finished pieces
- Curiosity over certainty

## What This Isn't

Not a portfolio. Not a brand. Not an audience-first space designed for metrics and engagement.

Just a studio. Come back when you like.
